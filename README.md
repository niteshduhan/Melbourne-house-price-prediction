🏡 Melbourne House Price Prediction — Data Science & Machine Learning Project

This project focuses on building a predictive model for estimating house prices in Melbourne using the Melbourne Housing Market dataset. It covers the complete end-to-end data science workflow — from exploratory data analysis to feature engineering, model development, model evaluation, and deployment.

🚀 Project Overview

The goal of this project is to develop a reliable and interpretable machine learning model capable of predicting property prices based on key factors such as location, property type, land size, building area, room count, and market conditions.

The project follows a structured pipeline:

Week 1–2: Understanding the dataset, cleaning missing values, handling categorical variables.
Week 3: Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) — uncovering trends, correlations, and outliers.
Week 4: Feature Engineering — encoding, scaling, treating skewness, creating new features.
Week 5: Model Building & Evaluation using Linear Regression, Random Forests, Gradient Boosting, and XGBoost.
Deployment: Preparing a Streamlit web app to allow users to interactively input property details and get a price prediction.
